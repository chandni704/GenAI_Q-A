# 💬 GenAI Question-Answering App

This project is a simple yet powerful **Question-Answering (Q&A) application** built using **Streamlit** and **Generative AI**. It allows users to input a question and receive intelligent, context-aware answers using an underlying language model. Developed during the **GenAI Workshop**, this app showcases the potential of large language models (LLMs) in building real-time conversational interfaces.
